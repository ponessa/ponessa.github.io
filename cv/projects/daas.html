            <p>It used to be that data existed in a box and when one system needed data from another, the data was physically moved 
			or accessed through some form of distributed processing or federation.  However, the replication of application 
			functionality and data using point to point connections is not a sustainable paradigm.  As our industry entered the 
			2000&apos;s, and the number of enterprise applications and systems proliferated, people realized that there needed to 
			be more direct communications between applications, which introduced another layer of interface, which was eventually 
			labeled Enterprise Application Integration, or EAI.  The idea was that if these systems could be integrated, existing 
			functionality could be reused instead of replicated across multiple systems.  The reduced functional redundancy meant 
			that functionality only needed to be maintained and enhanced within a single system saving time and money in development, 
			testing, and deployments.</p>
			<p>Application integration began with the application programming interface (API) to expose system functionality to external processes. 
			Where this worked okay it still required application to be written in the same language and running on the same platform.  This led to 
			language and platform specific adaptors, implementing the mediator pattern, in order to integrate systems; however these adaptors 
			were difficult to maintain and not widely adopted.</p>
			<p>The next phase of the integration evolution attempted to expose system function and data through platform independent means.  
			Over time, the EAI industry started widely promoting the use of a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) using the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) 
			specification, which used existing EAI methodology of integrating applications through the use of messaging.  Web Services, which facilitated 
			the SOA, exposed the system&apos;s functions in a language and platform independent manner.</p>
			<p>Data as a Service, or DaaS is the next logical extension of SOA.  If data is needed, it is requested and delivered in a message based, 
			language and platform independent method; without requiring an extract, transformation, and load (ETL) process or reporting packages.  The 
			concept of data-as-a-service advocates accessing data "where it lives" -- the actual platform on which the data resides doesn&apos;t matter.  
			With data-as-a-service, any business process can access data wherever it resides.</p>

			<p>Finally, the DaaS solution contains has a J2EE Rich Internet Application (RIA) client implemented with the Dojo toolkit.</p>
