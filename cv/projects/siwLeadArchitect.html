			<p>A <strong>data warehouse</strong> is a single, complete, and consistent store of data obtained from a variety of sources and made available 
to end users in a way they can understand and use in business content.</p>
<p>The concept of data warehousing has evolved out of the need for easy access to a structured store of 
quality data that can be used for decision making. It is globally accepted that information is a very powerful asset that can 
provide significant benefits to any organization and a competitive advantage in the business world.&nbsp; Organizations have vast amounts of 
data but have found it increasingly difficult to access it and make use of it.&nbsp; This is because it is in many different formats, exists on many 
different platforms, and resides in many different file and database structures developed by different groups using different vendor software. Thus 
organizations have had to write and maintain perhaps hundreds of programs that are used to extract, prepare, and consolidate data for use by many different 
applications for analysis and reporting.&nbsp; Also, decision makers often want to dig deeper into the data once initial findings are made.&nbsp; This would 
typically require modification of the extract programs or development of new ones. This process is costly, inefficient, and very time consuming.&nbsp; Data 
warehousing offers a better approach.</p>

<p>The data warehouse can be considered the place where a company publishes data.&nbsp; Data is not simply accumulated at a central point and turned over to business users.&nbsp; Rather the
data is assembled from a variety of information sources around the organization, cleansed, enhanced, quality assured, and then release at the discretion of the 
data quality manager. The data quality manager is much like a magazine editor or book publisher, they are responsible for the content and quality of the 
published data and are identified with each deliverable.</p>

<p>The data warehouse solution provides access to consistent corporate data, where two people presenting the same business result will not end up with different numbers 
and that a line item within a summarized report will tie back to the sum of a related detailed report.&nbsp; This sounds intuitive, however data warehouse solution’s inability 
to accomplish this is serious point of frustration expressed by senior management.</p>

<p>A data warehouse solution is not just data and data structures, but also a set of tools to query, analyze, and present information.&nbsp; The goal of the a data warehouse 
solution is to provide the tools and facilities to manage and deliver complete, timely, accurate, and understandable business information to authorized individuals for effective 
business decision making.&nbsp; The “back room” components (HW, relational database SW, the data itself) comprise only 70% of what is needed for a successful data warehouse.&nbsp; 
The remaining 30% is the set of front end tools that query, analyze, and present the information, transforming raw data into vital business intelligence.&nbsp; The data in a warehouse 
must be able to be combined and separated to support every measurement required by the business (the “slice and dice” requirements).</p>

<p>Finally, unlike traditional projects with fixed requirements, data warehousing must address both requirements known today and unknown requirements that will be discovered in the 
future. So, where traditional IT projects have a finite end, a data warehouse must continually evolve to address new and changing user requirements. This process requires a 
flexible architecture that allows business data to be accessed from a variety of applications and systems to support decision-makers across the enterprise.</p>

            <h3>System Context Diagram</h3>
			<p>System Context Diagrams represent all external entities that may interact with a system. Such a diagram pictures the system at the center, with no details of its interior structure, surrounded by all its interacting systems, environments and activities. The objective of the system context diagram is to focus attention on external factors and events that should be considered in developing a complete set of systems requirements and constraints.</p>

			<h3>SIW Operational Model</h3>

			<p>The operational model focuses on the distribution of an IT system’s components onto geographically distributed nodes with the connections&nbsp;necessary to support component interactions. &nbsp;The operational model describes the architecture in terms of computers, associated peripherals, and systems software for the IT solution.</p>
