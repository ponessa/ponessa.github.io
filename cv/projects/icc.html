				<p>The Information Catalog is the heart of an information warehouse solution.  It is an essential component of the architecture that is 
				used to integrate all components of the solution.  It enables users to understand the source data, target data, and the rules that are 
				used to extract, filter, enhance, cleanse, and transform source data to target data, the schema of the data, how the data interrelates, 
				the business processes the data is used to support, what data is available to them, etc.</p>
				<p>BMSIW users were frustrated with the quality and currency of documentation that described the tables and attributes available 
				to them within the BMSIW decision support system.  Despite multiple efforts, workload and shifting priorities kept the BMSIW team 
				from being able to keep an &quot;information catalog&quot; up to date.</p>
				<p>It was decided that instead of trying to manually maintain an information catalog, we&apos;d start generating one instead.  The 
				BMSIW decided to follow the model of Java&apos;s Javadoc, which is a documentation generator for generating API documentation in 
				HTML format from Java source code. The HTML format is used to add the convenience of being able to hyperlink related documents together.</p>
				<p>The BMSIW put in place a standard that stated that all DB2 objects belonging to the BMSIW must have:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Business definitions for all tables</li>
					<li>The Label attribute populated for all tables linking the table to a defined BMSIW subject area.</li>
					<li>Business definitions for all columns </li>
				</ol>
				<p>With these three rules in place, the Information Catalog Compiler was written to read table, column, index, and view information 
				from the DB2 system catalog, augment it with business information stored in XML files, and generate a navigable set of HTML pages 
				that make up an information catalog.</p>

				<p>This worked fine for years but there were limitations</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Inability to intermix multiple sources and versions.  With the SIW expanding into multiple data tiers, and multiple versions of each, a new paradigm was needed.</li>
					<li>No API interface into the information catalog</li>
					<li>ICC relied on data within the DB2 System Catalog which limited its ability to build a catalog for non-DB2 repositories (e.g. PDA).</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Therefore it was re-written to be 100% XML driven.  Instead of being driven partially from the DB2 system catalog and partially from 
				XML documents, the entire catalog will be generated from XML. Utilities were provided, written using DB2 PureXml, that will generate the 
				appropriate XML based on both the DB2 and PDA system catalogs. A new interface that will emulate the Dojo API viewer.  This will enable users 
				to easily switch between SIW data tiers and versions and do side by side comparisons of both.</p>
				<p>The new catalog viewer allows users to select between data tiers and versions.</p>
