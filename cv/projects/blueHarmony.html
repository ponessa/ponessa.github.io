				<p>BlueHarmony enables IBM's "Globally Integrated Enterprise" strategy.  It is IBM's next major transformation program to radically simplify the design and operation of three Globally Integrated Support Processes - Finance, Opportunity-to-Order, and Order-to-Cash.

			<p>I led the requirements gathering, data modeling, solution architecture, and solution design of the integrated BMSIW - BlueHarmony Release through multiple iterations.  Led 
			an extended team of 12 business analysts and data modelers to develop and enhance a subject area model around customer information, customer contracts, billings, project management, 
			project &amp; cost accounting, and materials. This model enables integrated reporting during the BH transition, and contains significant enhancements and new data feeds that will to be used well after the transition. The new model contains 115 new data entities and 5 new feeds from both BH and non-BH systems and will be the starting point for the Services IW ODS’s ADL (Operational Data Store’s Atomic Data Layer).</p>
			<p>I lead the 2,104 member BH – BMSIW Integration Community and conduct a weekly Q&A session based on discussion threads entered within the forum portlet of the community.</p>
			<p>Redesigned Work Breakdown Structure feed from BH after deployment when real volumes exceeded estimated volume by a 10x order of magnitude.  New design increased throughput from 
			32K to 975K/minute and reduced delta processing from 12 to 1.5 hours.</p>
