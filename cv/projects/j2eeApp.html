				<p>Architected 40+ n-tier J2EE applications consisting of AIX, and Linux Servers, WebSphere Application Server, 
				DB2, and web servers (IHS).  These were J2EE thin web and single page clients, that used a myriad of open sourced toolkits and packages,
				with a DB2 zOS backend database that follows 
				the single channel, self-service business pattern as defined in IBM Patterns for e-Business and exploits the J2EE Model 2 architecture. 
				The model 2 architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.  A number of these applications also included Web 2.0 
				features such as Rich Internet Application and AJAX and frameworks that enable the application to read and write to an object whose 
				structure is not known until run time.</p>

				<p>As part of developing these applications, I developed a number of reusable toolkits - sets of related and reusable classes designed to provide 
				useful, general-purpose functionality. These toolkits didn't impose a particular design on an application, they simply provide functionality that any 
				application may use, thus avoiding recoding common functionality. </p>
				<p>These toolkits relied heavily on established design patters. Design patterns names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design 
				structure that makes the pattern useful for creating a reusable Object Oriented Design.   They identifies participating classes, their role and 
				collaborations, and the distribution of responsibilities. <p>
				<p>Finally, whenever possible, applications and packages were bundled as frameworks, emphasizing design reuse. A framework is a set of cooperating 
				classes that make up a reusable design for a specific class of software.  The framework dictates the architecture, defining its overall structure, 
				its partitioning into classes, the key responsibilities of these classes, how they collaborate, and the thread of control.  In most cases applicatons 
				could board or use these framework simply by configuring an XML document and not be required to write any code.  The BMS Revalidation 
				Framework is an example of such a framework.  At it's peak, the framework had 34 BTE applications boarded, processed 3M+ authorizations, sent 
				notifications to 500K+ managers, and has an annual cost avoidance of $300K. Other frameworks include a Data Marshalling, Decision Tree, 
				Expression Evaluator, and Data as a Service Frameworks.</p>
				<p>These applications  include, BMS Revalidation Framework and Dashboard, ICLA Account Delegation, ILC Mnemonic Registration, FMS “Black Box” cost 
				redistribution, On-Line Services Signings, BMSIW Explain Tool, and SSO Knowledge Management Application.</p>
				
				<p>Along with J2EE web application I Built and deployed a number of Java and XML/XSLT based tools that automated laborious and tedious processes 
				such as the of compiling and publishing an information and mass updating database objects.  These tools rely on XML's ability to separate content 
				from presentation.  By applying different stylesheets to the same document, an XML document can be rendered in different formats.  Along with 
				delivering higher quality deliverables by eliminating human error, these tools have saved 1000s of hours, and are still actively used today.</p>
				<p>These tools include Information Catalog Compiler &amp; Viewer, Wiki publishing standards and tools, zOS Batch Choreographer, jSqlParser, SSO MVS 
				Community Site.</p>
