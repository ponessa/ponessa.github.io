				<p>The IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator for IBM z/OS (IDAA) combines IBM System Z, 
				DB2 for z/OS, and IBM PureData System for Analytics technologies to accelerate the
				execution of complex queries in a DB2-for-z/OS environment and deliver unsurpassed, 
				mixed-workload performance for complex business analytics.  By using IDAA with System z, you get a modern 
				environment that helps create fast insights from large volumes of data and deliver those insights seamlessly.</p>
				<p>IDAA will alleviate end-user frustration with slow queries, offload processing and CPU cycles from the 
				z/OS system, and enable users to analyze large quantities of data quickly; and it does this without the user 
				even being aware that IDAA exits in the background.  IDAA is an appliance that adds another Resource Manager to 
				DB2 for z/OS, just like Lock Manager or Data Manager. It can be seen as an additional access path for dynamic SQL 
				statements in DB2 for z/OS.  No changes are required to existing applications because neither users nor applications 
				are, or need to be, aware of its existence to take advantage of its capabilities.  Whenever queries are eligible for 
				being processed by IDAA, users will immediately benefit from shortened response times without any further actions.</p>

				<h3>How does PDA/IDAA achieve performance?</h3>
				<p>PDA uses a divide and conquer strategy.  Each appliance contains a minimum of 96 1TB Disks and 96 S-blade drives, 
				each with their own memory and CPU.  The data is spread or distributed across the blades based on how the data 
				is accesses. As programs are executed, the host compiles the code and distributes queries across individual S-Blades
				or SPUs (Snippet Processing Units) to run in parallel. Once distributed, the SPUs perform the processing with FPGAs 
				optimized to process streaming data.  FPGA first filters out only the relevant columns needed by the query and then 
				processes the “WHERE” clause as data streams off of the disk, so only the data needed for processing is moved to the 
				next step.  When the processing is complete, the SMP host aggregates the results.</p>
